# Roadmap

## Planned changes

- Release on GitHub
- Upgrade the frontend from the single file setup
- Add retry logic for all API requests (including Anthropic, not just Perplexity); potentially using a package for this
- Optimize API request rate by parallelizing requests
- Create a secure BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) system for API keys
- Publish the tool as a website

## Future ideas

- Turn into a website that collects the custom LLM-based tools that I use, and make it pubically available for others to use as well

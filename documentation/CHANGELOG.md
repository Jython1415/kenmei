# Changelog

This changelog attempts to follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. It adheres to semantic versioning, but since it is a website in development, the versioning is not strictly followed. Major updates will be used for breaking changes to the API (except before v1.0.0), but the major version may not be incremented for "breaking" changes to the UI.
